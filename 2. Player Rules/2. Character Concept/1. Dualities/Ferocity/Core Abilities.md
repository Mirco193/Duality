# Core Abilities:

## Rage 

**Rank 1: Rage**  ➤ <br> 
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. You gain a number of **temporary Hit Points equal to half of your maximum Hit Points**. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first. Trying to stop raging before (because an enemy surrendered, e.g.) requires a WIS+Fortitude check against 11. 

	
While you are raging:

- You deal **2** additional damage with melee weapons, weapons that you throw and unarmed attacks. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.
   
- You can’t use actions with the concentrate trait. 

After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can’t Rage again for 1 minute.
